This project is to develop a Virtual Mouse using Hand Gesture Recognition. 
The hand gestures are the most effortless and natural way of communication.
The aim is to perform various operations of the cursor. 
Instead of using more expensive sensors, a simple web camera can identify the gesture and perform the action. 
It helps the user to interact with a computer without any physical and hardware device to control mouse operation.
