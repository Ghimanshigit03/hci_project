# Virtual Touch üñêÔ∏è

With the present-day advances in VR (Virtual Reality) and its utility in each day lives, Bluetooth and wi-fi automation are getting more and more accessible. Instead of the use of fashionable headsets or outside devices, the proposed system tracks finger and hand movements and uses a webcam or built-in camera to process the computer. It's simple and effective.

- Virtual Touch is a project demonstrating the fusion of MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI to create a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures.
-  With this innovative system, users can seamlessly control volume, adjust brightness, and perform left and right clicks and double clicks
-	This project is to develop a Virtual Mouse using Hand Gesture Recognition.
-	The hand gestures are the most effortless and natural way of communication.
-	The aim is to perform various operations of the cursor.
-	Instead of using more expensive sensors, a simple web camera can identify the gesture and perform the action.
-	It helps the user to interact with a computer without any physical and hardware device to control mouse operation.
